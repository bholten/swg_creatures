# Introduction

This is data from the SWGEmu Core3 repository. It interprets the Lua scripts and outputs them as CSV, which you can then download and import into Excel, LibreOffice, RStudio, or whatever editor you like.

This data is very lightly processed -- for example, Core3 uses a convention where effective resists are greater than 100%; here, creature resists are normalized and there are flags indicating if the resist is special or effective.

See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bholten/swg_creatures) for full details.
